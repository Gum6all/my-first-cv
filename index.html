                I am a twelve-year-old blue cat who is prone to causing mischief
                across the town due to not staying inside of the box. He is
                fairly egotistical and a veteran snarker; despite this, I has a
                big heart and is surprisingly selfless. Although I can be
                intelligent at times, he is not very wise, often doing things in
                the most convoluted of manners and gearing his energy towards
                fruitless endeavors.

                Darwin Raglan Caspian Ahab Poseidon Nicodemus Watterson III is
                the deuteragonist in The Amazing World of Gumball. He used to be
                Gumball's pet goldfish, but one day, he grew legs and generally
                adapted to life outside of water, so he was adopted by the
                Watterson family.

                Richard Buckley Watterson is one of the main characters in The
                Amazing World of Gumball. He serves the role of the father in
                the Watterson family. Unlike the traditional father, however,
                Richard is not wise, nor is he a good role model for his
                children in any way. Despite his misguided advice and uncouth
                mannerisms, Richard has good intentions and loves his family all
                the same.

                Doctor Nicole Watterson is one of the main characters of The
                Amazing World of Gumball. Nicole is the mother of the Watterson
                family and is the backbone and only truly responsible member of
                the family. She is very dedicated to her family and would do
                anything in her power to keep them comfortable and safe.

                Anais Errrrrr Watterson is the tritagonist and one of the main
                characters of The Amazing World of Gumball. She is the youngest
                member of the Watterson family and the most rational, despite
                being only four years old. She is in 8th (and later 9th) grade
                at Elmore Junior High which she attends with her older brothers,
                Gumball and Darwin, and is in a higher grade than them, as
                revealed in "The Others."
